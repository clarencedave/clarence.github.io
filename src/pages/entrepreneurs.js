    <h3>How does Seattle Angel Conference Work?</h3>
    <p>Two months prior to the next the Seattle Angel Conference, interested investors apply to participate in the associated Investors LLC. For each investment round, a new collaborative process is kicked off supported by a team of experienced angel investors and fund managers. Extensive due diligence is performed before the investment decision is made at the conference in a majority voting format. During the due diligence process, entrepreneurs present their pitches and investors form small deep-dive groups to learn more and report back to the larger investors group during weekly meetings. Meetings can be joined in person or online. Participation in weekly due diligence meetings is encouraged but optional.</p>
