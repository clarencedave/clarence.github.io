# Seattle Angel Conference XV Company Applications
### by Seattle Angel Conference
The Seattle Angel Conference is a program for companies and new investors to engage in Angel Investing. We will gather 20-40 Angel Investors and raise a fund of $150K-200K . Our goal is to look at companies that are at or near first revenue, who would find an Angel Investment valuable.

We do a review of all the companies and provide feedback. The application deadline for companies is February 28th. Over the 12 weeks from the first week in March until the final event on May 15th, the investors will engage with some of the companies, filtering companies until they select a winner at the final event.

While the Investors will be meeting weekly, the companies will only engage on specific days:

Feb 28 (Thu) Deadline for companies to apply.

March 12 (Tu) If selected for Quarterfinals, expect email.

March 19 (Tu) 3-Minute pitch night #1 OR

March 20 (Wed) 3-Minute pitch night #2

March 26 (Tu) Expect to sign up for coffee meetings with Investor

April 2 (Tu) 10-Minute pitch night #1 OR

April 3 (Wed) 10-Minute pitch night #2

April 9 (Tu) If selected for Finals expect a confirmation email

April 16 (Tu) Due diligence week #1 (working meeting)

May 14 (Tu) Mixer with Finalists

May 15 (Wed) Final event, 12:30-6:00

As companies are not selected for the next round, you will be asked to schedule a debrief with one of the investors to review the company progress and to find pathways towards progress.

All of the events will be held at UW CoMotion HQ
